# Reconify
*A Lightweight Security Awareness & Risk Explanation Tool*
## Overview
Reconify is a lightweight security-awareness tool designed to help users
understand basic website exposure, interpret potential security risks,
and identify appropriate tools for safe and authorized security assessment.

The project follows a security-first approach, focusing on analysis,
clarity, and ethical responsibility rather than exploitation.
## Objective
The objective of Reconify is to:
- Perform basic and responsible reconnaissance checks
- Explain potential security risks in clear and simple language
- Highlight possible impact using easy-to-understand risk levels
- Guide users toward safe and authorized security testing tools
- ## Core Capabilities
Reconify performs limited and non-intrusive checks, including:
- Verification of website reachability
- Detection of common sensitive endpoints:
  - /admin
  - /login
- Context-based explanation of identified risks
- Risk categorization using clear levels:
  - LOW
  - MEDIUM
  - HIGH
- Guidance on ethical and authorized security validation tools
- ## Tools & Methodology
Reconify follows a simple, responsible, and ethical methodology:

- HTTP requests to verify website reachability
- Analysis of common sensitive endpoints
- Interpretation of findings into meaningful security impact
- Recommendation of industry-standard tools for further authorized validation

Suggested tools for authorized testing:
- Burp Suite – Access control and request analysis
- Nmap – Basic service and exposure enumeration
- ## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me develop:
- A solid understanding of basic reconnaissance concepts
- The ability to translate technical findings into clear explanations
- Ethical decision-making in security testing
- Structured documentation practices for security projects
- ## Future Enhancements
- Subdomain discovery (authorized scope only)
- Technology stack identification
- Improved risk scoring logic
- Exportable security summary reports
