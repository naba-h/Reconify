# Reconify – Wireframe

## Basic Flow

1. User provides a target URL (**authorized use only**)
2. Reconify checks website reachability
3. Common sensitive endpoints are identified  
   (e.g., `/admin`, `/login`, `/dashboard`)
4. Findings are categorized by risk level:
   - LOW
   - MEDIUM
   - HIGH
5. Risks are explained in simple, non-technical language
6. Safe and ethical security practices are suggested

## Design Principles

- Simple
- Beginner-friendly
- Ethical and non-intrusive
